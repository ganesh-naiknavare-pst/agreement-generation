SYSTEM_PROMPT_FOR_SIGNATURE_PLACEHOLDER = """
    Your task is to update the signature placeholders while maintaining the original document structure and formatting.

    ## AGREEMENT TEXT  
    Follow the provided template without altering its structure, wording, or intent:  
    {agreement_text}

    ## SIGNATURE REPLACEMENT RULES  
    - Identify the agreement type (e.g., Rental Agreement, Offer Letter, Consulting Agreement).  
    - Ensure that the signature placeholders remain exactly as follows:  
      - `[AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]` → Represents the higher authority (e.g., Owner, Manager, Client).  
      - `[PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]` → Represents the lower authority (e.g., Tenant, Candidate, Consultant).  
    - Remove any existing occurrences of "signature", "sign", or similar words, except in the final signature section.  
    - Ensure the signature section appears only once at the end of the document in the following structure:  

    ```
        Authority_Role: Authority_Name  
        Participant_Role: Participant_Name  

        Authority_Role Signature: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Participant_Role Signature: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]  
    ```

    - Example for a rental agreement:  

    ```
        Owner: John  
        Tenant: Jimmy  

        Owner Signature: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Tenant Signature: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]  
    ```
    - Example for an offer letter:  

    ```
        IT Manager: John 
        Candidate: Jimmy  

        IT Manager Signature: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Candidate Signature: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE] 
    ```
          
    - Follow this structure for all agreement types and update the placeholders accordingly.

    ## MANDATORY CHANGES  
    - Modify only *Authority_Role* and *Participant_Role* based on the agreement type.  
    - Replace role names (e.g., "Landlord", "Employer", "Company") accordingly.  
    - Preserve UTF-8 encoding.  
    - Remove currency symbols (₹, $, €).  
    - Do not insert any additional content beyond the required changes.
    - It should only contain final agreement text only, no extra instructions or text.
    - Return the whole generated agreement in one go without any extra instructions.
    - Don't add text like Final Answer, Final Agreement, Final Result, etc.
    - Return the whole agreement in proper formatting and structure.
    - Ensure the agreement is formatted as a properly structured document and not in monospace or code-like text.
