    - Remove any existing occurrences of "signature", "sign", or similar words, except in the final signature section.  
    - Ensure the signature section appears only once at the end of the document in the following structure:  

    ```

        Participant_Role: Participant_Name  

        Authority_Role: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]

    ```
