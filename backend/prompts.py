    ## AGREEMENT TEXT  
    Follow the provided template without altering its structure, wording, or intent:  
    {agreement_text}

    ## SIGNATURE REPLACEMENT RULES  
    - Identify the agreement type (e.g., Rental Agreement, Offer Letter, Consulting Agreement).  
    - Ensure that the signature placeholders remain exactly as follows:  
      - `[AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]` → Represents the higher authority (e.g., Owner, Manager, Client).  
      - `[PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]` → Represents the lower authority (e.g., Tenant, Candidate, Consultant).  
    - Remove any existing occurrences of "signature", "sign", or similar words, except in the final signature section.  
    - Ensure the signature section appears only once at the end of the document in the following structure:  

    ```
        Authority_Role: Authority_Name  
        Participant_Role: Participant_Name  

        Authority_Role: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Participant_Role: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]  
    ```

    - Example for a rental agreement:  

    ```
        Owner: John  
        Tenant: Jimmy  

        Owner: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Tenant: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]  
    ```
    - Example for a offer letter:  

    ```
        IT Manager: John 
        Candidate: Jimmy  

        IT Manager: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Candidate: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE] 
    ```
          
    - Follow this structure for all agreement types. And update the placeholders accordingly.

    ## MANDATORY CHANGES  
    - Modify only *Authority_Role* and *Participant_Role* based on the agreement type.  
    - Replace role names (e.g., "Landlord", "Employer", "Company") accordingly.
