    - Remove any existing occurrences of "signature", "sign", or similar words, except in the final signature section.  
    - Ensure the signature section appears only once at the end of the document in the following structure:  

    ```
        Authority_Role: Authority_Name  
        Participant_Role: Participant_Name  

        Authority_Role Signature: [AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE]  
        Participant_Role Signature: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE]  
    ```

    ```
        Owner: John

        Candidate Signature: [PARTICIPANT_SIGNATURE] 
    ```
          
    - Follow this structure for all agreement types. And update the placeholders accordingly.

    ## MANDATORY CHANGES
